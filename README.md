# file-changes-detector
Let me set the stage for you: I’m invested in this fund at Charles Schwab https://content.schwabplan.com/funddetail/CBFXP.pdf. 
Its performance is updated approximately every month. The problem is that I don’t know when the PDF receives its updates.
Sometimes it’s in the beginning of the month. Sometimes in the middle of the month. And at least once I saw no update for the entire month.

Rather than manually checking the PDF every day or every week for changes, 
I decided to write a Python program to automatically check for changes to the file every day and send me a notification if it found updates.
